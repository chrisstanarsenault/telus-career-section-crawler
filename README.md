# Telus Career Board Crawler

My first webcrawler I built, which crawls the [Telus career section](https://www.telus.com/en/digital/careers/) for any new Junior developer positions in my area. If found, puts them into a table format, and emails them to me. Checks once every 6 hours.

**_Built with Node/JS and [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/)._**
